## ⚠️ Important: Browser Compatibility Notice

**This HTML formatting preservation method works BEST on:**
- ✅ **Google Chrome** on Desktop (Windows/Mac) - **RECOMMENDED**
- ✅ **Microsoft Edge** on Desktop
- ✅ **Firefox** on Desktop

**DO NOT use with:**
- ❌ Microsoft Outlook Desktop App
- ❌ Apple Mail App
- ❌ Any MS Office/Mac Office email applications
- ❌ Mobile email apps (Gmail app, Outlook app, etc.)

**Why?** Desktop browsers preserve the HTML formatting perfectly when using this method. Email applications and mobile apps often strip or modify the HTML code, breaking the responsive design.

**For best results:** Always compose and send these emails using **Gmail in Chrome browser on Desktop**.

## 📧 Step-by-Step Email Sending Tutorial

### Step 1: Open the Email Template

You will receive the email template from your manager or team lead. Open that email in your inbox (Gmail or Google Workspace).

<div className="my-4 p-3 border border-blue-300 dark:border-blue-600 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/30 rounded-lg">

💡 **Alternative:** You can also copy the template directly from the **embedded email preview** available in this blog (scroll down to "Copy Email Template Directly" section). **Use Google Chrome on Desktop** for best results when pasting the content.

</div>

**What you'll see:**
- A professionally designed invitation with Phantom Healthcare branding
- The WHX Dubai 2026 event details
- Our stall number (N21.K110)
- Contact information and social media links
- Interactive button linking to our virtual stand

### Step 2: Select and Copy the Email Content

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Follow this EXACTLY**

1. **DO NOT use Ctrl+A** (Select All) - This will copy headers, subject line, and reply buttons which will break the formatting

2. **Use your mouse to manually select:**
   - Start from the TOP of the email content (just below the subject line area)
   - Drag down to the BOTTOM of the email content (just before the "Unsubscribe" text or footer)
   - Your selection should include ONLY the email body content

3. **Copy the selected content:**
   - Press **Ctrl+C** (Windows) or **Cmd+C** (Mac)
   - Or Right-click → Copy

### Step 3: Compose a New Email

1. Click **Compose** (Gmail) or **New Email** (other clients)
2. **IMPORTANT: Remove your email signature first!**
   - Click on the signature area at the bottom
   - Delete it completely
   - Our email template already has all contact information

### Step 4: Paste the Email Template

1. Click inside the email body area
2. Press **Ctrl+V** (Windows) or **Cmd+V** (Mac) to paste
3. The entire responsive email should appear with all formatting intact

**Why this works:** Our template is designed using Beefree and copied from preview mode, which preserves responsiveness even in Gmail/Outlook compose windows.

### Step 5: Add Recipients Using BCC

⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT: Always use BCC!**

**Why BCC?**
- Protects client privacy - recipients cannot see each other's email addresses
- Looks professional - each recipient thinks they received a personal email
- Required for GDPR/privacy compliance
- Prevents "Reply All" disasters

**How to add BCC recipients:**

1. Click on **BCC** field (next to "To" field)
2. Add recipient email addresses separated by commas
3. Leave the **"To"** field empty OR add your own email address
4. **Recommended:** Put your own email in "To" field to track delivery

### Step 6: Add Subject Line

Use a clear, professional subject line:

**Recommended Subject Lines:**
- `Invitation: Meet Phantom Healthcare at WHX Dubai 2026 - Stall N21.K110`
- `Join us at World Health Expo Dubai | Phantom Healthcare - Feb 9-12, 2026`
- `Special Invitation: WHX Dubai 2026 - Stall N21.K110, DEC Exhibition Center`

### Step 7: Send in Batches

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Follow batch limits to avoid spam filters!**

| Email Account Type | Max per Batch | Wait Between Batches | Daily Limit |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Free Gmail** (@gmail.com) | 10-15 | 15-20 minutes | 100-150/day |
| **Google Workspace** (@phantomhealthcare.com) | 15-20 | 15 minutes | 2000/day |

**Batch Sending Process:**

1. **Batch 1:** Add 10-15 BCC recipients → Send
2. **Wait 15-20 minutes** (do other work)
3. **Batch 2:** Add next 10-15 BCC recipients → Send
4. **Repeat** until all contacts are covered
5. **Track:** Keep a list of who you've sent to

---

## 🚨 Important Precautions

### Do's ✅

- ✅ Always use BCC for multiple recipients
- ✅ Remove your signature before pasting
- ✅ Send in small batches (10-15 at a time)
- ✅ Wait 15-20 minutes between batches
- ✅ Keep track of sent emails in a spreadsheet
- ✅ Personalize subject line if sending individually
- ✅ Test by sending to yourself first
- ✅ Check spam folder if test email doesn't arrive

### Don'ts ❌

- ❌ Never use Ctrl+A to select - breaks formatting
- ❌ Never add all recipients in "To" or "CC" field
- ❌ Never send more than 15 emails in one batch
- ❌ Never exceed daily sending limits
- ❌ Don't send same email to same person twice
- ❌ Don't forward the email - always paste fresh

### 🗓️ Emoji Tip: Avoid Date Confusion!

<div className="my-4 p-4 border border-orange-300 dark:border-orange-600 bg-orange-50 dark:bg-orange-900/30 rounded-lg">

**⚠️ Calendar Emoji Warning:**

If you're customizing the template with emojis, be careful with calendar emojis:

| Emoji | Name | What it Shows | Use? |
|-------|------|---------------|------|
| 📅 | Calendar | **July 17** (World Emoji Day) | ❌ Confusing! |
| 📆 | Tear-off Calendar | **31** | ❌ Confusing! |
| 🗓️ | **Spiral Calendar** | Generic lines | ✅ Safe to use! |

**Why it matters:** Recipients may see "July 17" or "31" and think those are the event dates instead of **9-12 Feb 2026**!

**Safe alternative:** Use 🗓️ (Spiral Calendar) which shows generic calendar lines, or simply use text without date emojis.

## 📱 Why Our Template Works Everywhere

We designed this email using **Beefree** and use a professional **HTML Content Transfer Protocol** from preview mode. This ensures:

- ✅ **Responsive design** - looks great on desktop AND mobile
- ✅ **Consistent rendering** - works in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
- ✅ **Images display correctly** - properly linked and sized
- ✅ **CTA buttons work** - all links functional
- ✅ **No code stripping** - Gmail doesn't remove our styling

Traditional email marketing tools (Mailchimp, Constant Contact) are great for mass emails, but for personal sending by sales executives, this copy-paste method gives better deliverability and personal touch.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Email looks broken after pasting?

- Make sure you selected ONLY the email body content
- Don't use Ctrl+A - use mouse selection
- Try pasting in a new compose window
- Check if signature was removed before pasting

### Email going to spam?

- Send in smaller batches (5-10)
- Increase wait time between batches (30 min)
- Add a personal line at the top like "Dear [Name],"
- Avoid spam trigger words in subject line

### Images not showing?

- This is normal for first view in some email clients
- Recipients need to click "Display images" once
- All images are properly hosted and will load

### Formatting lost?

- Re-copy from the original template email
- Make sure you're pasting in HTML mode (not plain text)
- Gmail sometimes auto-converts - try again

### Button link not working?

- The "CLICK TO VISIT OUR VIRTUAL STAND" button links to: https://connections.whxevents.com/event/whx-dubai-2026/exhibitor/RXhoaWJpdG9yXzIzMzc3NDE%3D
- Test the button by sending yourself a test email first
- If it doesn't work, ask your manager for the updated template
