## 📧 Step-by-Step Email Sending Tutorial

### Step 1: Open the Email Template

You will receive the email template from your manager or team lead. Open that email in your inbox (Gmail or Google Workspace).

**What you'll see:**
- A professionally designed invitation with Phantom Healthcare branding
- The IRIA 2026 event details
- Our stall number (D-2)
- Contact information and social media links

### Step 2: Select and Copy the Email Content

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Follow this EXACTLY**

1. **DO NOT use Ctrl+A** (Select All) - This will copy headers, subject line, and reply buttons which will break the formatting

2. **Use your mouse to manually select:**
   - Start from the TOP of the email content (just below the subject line area)
   - Drag down to the BOTTOM of the email content (just above the Reply/Forward buttons)
   - Your selection should include ONLY the email body content

3. **Copy the selected content:**
   - Press **Ctrl+C** (Windows) or **Cmd+C** (Mac)
   - Or Right-click → Copy

  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Select ONLY the email body - avoid headers and footer buttons</figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 3: Compose a New Email

1. Click **Compose** (Gmail) or **New Email** (other clients)
2. **IMPORTANT: Remove your email signature first!**
   - Click on the signature area at the bottom
   - Delete it completely
   - Our email template already has all contact information

### Step 4: Paste the Email Template

1. Click inside the email body area
2. Press **Ctrl+V** (Windows) or **Cmd+V** (Mac) to paste
3. The entire responsive email should appear with all formatting intact

**Why this works:** Our template is designed using Beefree and copied from preview mode, which preserves responsiveness even in Gmail/Outlook compose windows.

### Step 5: Add Recipients Using BCC

⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT: Always use BCC!**

**Why BCC?**
- Protects client privacy - recipients cannot see each other's email addresses
- Looks professional - each recipient thinks they received a personal email
- Required for GDPR/privacy compliance
- Prevents "Reply All" disasters

**How to add BCC recipients:**

1. Click on **BCC** field (next to "To" field)
2. Add recipient email addresses separated by commas
3. Leave the **"To"** field empty OR add your own email address
4. **Recommended:** Put your own email in "To" field to track delivery

### Step 6: Add Subject Line

Use a clear, professional subject line:

**Recommended Subject Lines:**
- `Invitation: Meet Phantom Healthcare at IRIA 2026 - Stall D-2`
- `Join us at IRIA 2026 | Phantom Healthcare - Stall D-2, HITEX Hyderabad`
- `Special Invitation: 78th IRIA Conference - 29 Jan to 1 Feb 2026`

### Step 7: Send in Batches

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Follow batch limits to avoid spam filters!**

| Email Account Type | Max per Batch | Wait Between Batches | Daily Limit |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Free Gmail** (@gmail.com) | 10-15 | 15-20 minutes | 100-150/day |
| **Google Workspace** (@phantomhealthcare.com) | 15-20 | 15 minutes | 2000/day |

**Batch Sending Process:**

1. **Batch 1:** Add 10-15 BCC recipients → Send
2. **Wait 15-20 minutes** (do other work)
3. **Batch 2:** Add next 10-15 BCC recipients → Send
4. **Repeat** until all contacts are covered
5. **Track:** Keep a list of who you've sent to

## 🚨 Important Precautions

### Do's ✅

- ✅ Always use BCC for multiple recipients
- ✅ Remove your signature before pasting
- ✅ Send in small batches (10-15 at a time)
- ✅ Wait 15-20 minutes between batches
- ✅ Keep track of sent emails in a spreadsheet
- ✅ Personalize subject line if sending individually
- ✅ Test by sending to yourself first
- ✅ Check spam folder if test email doesn't arrive

### Don'ts ❌

- ❌ Never use Ctrl+A to select - breaks formatting
- ❌ Never add all recipients in "To" or "CC" field
- ❌ Never send more than 15 emails in one batch
- ❌ Never exceed daily sending limits
- ❌ Don't send during odd hours (best: 10 AM - 6 PM)
- ❌ Don't send same email to same person twice
- ❌ Don't forward the email - always paste fresh

## 📱 Why Our Template Works Everywhere

We designed this email using **Beefree** and use a special copy-paste technique from preview mode. This ensures:

- ✅ **Responsive design** - looks great on desktop AND mobile
- ✅ **Consistent rendering** - works in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
- ✅ **Images display correctly** - properly linked and sized
- ✅ **CTA buttons work** - all links functional
- ✅ **No code stripping** - Gmail doesn't remove our styling

Traditional email marketing tools (Mailchimp, Constant Contact) are great for mass emails, but for personal sending by sales executives, this copy-paste method gives better deliverability and personal touch.

## 📋 Copy Email Template Directly

If you haven't received the email template from your manager, you can copy it directly from the embedded window below:

<div className="my-8 p-4 border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800">

**📧 Email Template Access Options:**

1. **Option 1:** Request the template email from your manager/team lead
2. **Option 2:** Access the template from our internal shared drive (link shared via WhatsApp group)
3. **Option 3:** Contact IT/Marketing team for direct template file

**Note:** The embedded template will be updated here once available. For now, please use Option 1 or 2.

*Template Last Updated: January 2026*
