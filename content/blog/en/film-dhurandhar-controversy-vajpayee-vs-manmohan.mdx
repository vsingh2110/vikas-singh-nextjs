# Film Dhurandhar Controversy | Vajpayee Government vs Manmohan Singh Government | Psychological Warfare

## Opening Note: Akshay Khanna's Career-Defining Performance

Let me be clear from the outset: **Akshay Khanna's portrayal of Rahman Dakait is nothing short of extraordinary.** The action sequences are well-executed, the cinematography is polished, and the production values are impressive. But what truly ignited a firestorm across the internet was Khanna's visceral, haunting performance.

After 26 years in the industry, he's delivered a role so intense and layered that it overshadows even the film's biggest stars. **Rahman Dakait is terrifyingly powerful** - social media can't stop talking about it, critics are calling it his career-best, and audiences are transfixed. The conviction, the menace, the psychological terror he brings to this character is unforgettable.

**I went into this film primarily to watch Khanna's work.** And while the technical craft is undeniable, what I discovered was far more troubling: **this film is a masterclass in psychological manipulation.** Beneath the surface of entertainment lies a sophisticated arsenal of propaganda techniques that most viewers won't consciously recognize.

**As a social psychologist**, I'm compelled to dissect how this film systematically deploys advanced manipulation strategies - **Cognitive Dissonance Marketing, Truth Anchoring, Discourse Policing, Auditory Conditioning, Narrative Ambiguity, Selective Amnesia, Emotional Manipulation, and Manufactured Consent.** This isn't just cinema. It's calculated psychological warfare.

## Attack on Film Critics: Discourse Policing and the Architecture of Silence

From the moment Dhurandhar hit theaters, controversy followed. First came the Delhi High Court petition. Then, when film critics and reviewers published their professional analyses, they faced a coordinated campaign of intimidation designed to create a culture of fear around dissent.

### The Systematic Silencing Campaign

The most egregious case involved **Anupama Chopra** - a veteran film critic with decades of experience, founder of Film Companion, and one of India's most respected voices in cinema. She, along with critics like Raja Sen and others, was subjected to a torrent of abuse: rape threats, death threats targeting family members, sexually explicit harassment, and doxxing attempts.

**This wasn't random internet trolling. It was a coordinated digital attack with all the hallmarks of organized warfare:**

- **Mass Mobilization**: Thousands of accounts activated simultaneously with coordinated timing
- **Threat Escalation Ladder**: Starting with criticism, escalating to personal attacks, then family threats, then explicit violence
- **Family Targeting**: Critics' children's photos circulated, personal information leaked - classic psychological warfare tactics
- **Platform Flooding**: Simultaneous attacks across Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube
- **Hashtag Hijacking**: Organized brigading on every critic's post
- **Strategic Doxxing**: Attempts to expose private information to enable real-world harassment

Critics were labeled "Pakistani agents" and "terrorist supporters." But here's what's crucial: **no one addressed the actual substance of their criticism.** The film's historical distortions, political bias, factual inaccuracies - none of these were debated. Instead, dissent was drowned in accusations of treason and anti-nationalism.

### Discourse Policing: When Criticism Becomes Treason

The psychological mechanism is devastatingly simple: **Link dissent to betrayal.** When questioning becomes equated with treason, self-censorship becomes inevitable.

**The psychological effects compound:**

- **Anticipatory Obedience**: People comply before being asked, to avoid potential consequences
- **Chilling Effect on Speech**: The mere threat of retaliation narrows the boundaries of acceptable discourse
- **Normalization of Aggression**: Threats become so routine they're eventually accepted as normal
- **Fear of Social Ostracism**: Professional and personal networks become tools of enforcement
- **Self-Censorship Cascade**: Each silenced voice makes the next person more reluctant to speak

This is textbook authoritarianism. History shows us repeatedly: **authoritarian movements always begin by criminalizing dissent**, by framing criticism as conspiracy, by declaring questioners enemies of the state. What we're witnessing isn't debate - it's the deliberate construction of enforced consensus.

## Major Mohit Sharma Case: A Masterclass in Cognitive Dissonance Marketing

Before diving into the film's content, we need to examine the pre-release controversy - a textbook case of viral marketing psychology that deserves study in every advertising class.

###The Family's Dignified Stand

**The first betrayal was of the hero himself.** Major Mohit Sharma's parents filed a petition in Delhi High Court with specific, detailed concerns:

> "The hero's appearance in the film trailer - the look, the styling - bears striking similarity to our son. When Major Sharma went undercover, infiltrating terrorist groups as a Kashmiri Muslim in an extraordinarily dangerous mission, he grew his hair and beard in this exact manner. Multiple details appear to have been directly copied. We're not asking for much. We simply want to know: why weren't we consulted? If our son's life inspired even part of this story, didn't we deserve at least a conversation?"

His brother gave an emotional yet dignified interview to Hindustan Times:

**"We don't want a single rupee from the film's profits. We don't want monetary compensation. We just want to know: if they drew inspiration from our brother's life, if they used elements of his story, shouldn't they have at least contacted us once? A simple acknowledgment - that's all we're asking for."**

### The Viral Marketing Machine

The story exploded. Mainstream news channels, digital platforms, social media - everywhere. Instagram influencers made tear-jerking videos, YouTubers released detailed analyses, Twitter hashtags trended nationwide.

**But here's what's fascinating: the film team said absolutely nothing publicly.** No clarification. No denial. No response. Yet behind this conspicuous silence, they aggressively continued promoting the film.

**This bore all the hallmarks of orchestrated viral marketing:**

- **Controversy as Currency**: Negative publicity is still publicity
- **Mysterious Origins**: No one could trace where the story first leaked - suspiciously convenient
- **Strategic Amplification**: The timing, platforms, and messaging showed signs of deliberate coordination
- **Emotional Exploitation**: Building sympathy while generating buzz
- **Free Media Coverage**: Millions of rupees worth of publicity at zero cost
- **Curiosity Maximization**: Public interest skyrocketed

### The 180-Degree Legal Pivot

Then came the twist. When the matter reached High Court and formal legal notice arrived, director **Aditya Dhar** (who also wrote and produced the film) immediately issued a public statement on Twitter/X:

**"This film is absolutely not based on Major Mohit Sharma's real life. It is entirely fictional."**

**In one stroke, all legal liability evaporated.**

This is textbook **Cognitive Dissonance Marketing** - exploiting the gap between what audiences perceive and what can be legally proven:

**The Dual Messaging Strategy:**

- **Public Perception**: Let audiences believe it's a true story based on authentic events (building emotional investment)
- **Legal Position**: Maintain plausible deniability with fiction disclaimers (avoiding lawsuits)
- **Strategic Ambiguity**: Send contradictory signals deliberately (confusion sustains interest)
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Emotional authenticity of non-fiction + legal protection of fiction

**Audience Psychology:**
- Viewers believe what they want to believe: "This is a real story"
- Filmmakers remain legally shielded: "We never actually claimed that"
- This is manufactured cognitive dissonance - and it's entirely deliberate

**The filmmakers faced a strategic necessity**: they wanted to make politically charged claims, add fictional elements, present speculative theories, and inject politically motivated interpretations. Using the real martyr's actual name would have opened them to overwhelming legal liability. So they created just enough similarity to benefit from the association while maintaining just enough distance to avoid consequences.

This isn't creative freedom. It's calculated exploitation.

## The Film's Dual Identity: Strategic Narrative Ambiguity

The film opens with a prominently displayed disclaimer (standard legal protection in virtually every film):

> **"This film is based on fictional events. It has no connection with any real person, object, place, group, or incident. Any resemblance is purely coincidental."**

Yet when you watch attentively, analyze carefully, the film **stylistically shifts between fiction and documentary** in strategically calculated moments. Most of it feels like typical Bollywood masala - dramatic music, larger-than-life action. But certain segments transform entirely: slow pacing, somber tone, the aesthetic of archival footage, the weight of investigative journalism.

### Deliberate Strategic Ambiguity

This **narrative ambiguity is not accidental. It's weaponized:**

**Strategic Benefits:**

- **Legal Deniability Intact**: In court, point to the fiction disclaimer  
- **Emotional Believability Maximized**: Audiences feel "This is real, these are true events"
- **Legal Protection Shield**: Defamation suits become technically difficult to prosecute
- **Psychological Manipulation**: Viewers' critical thinking gets suspended in the confusion
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Fiction's creative freedom + non-fiction's credibility

**The film focuses on four major incidents** that have drawn serious objection. Three are already well-known from WhatsApp forwards and TV debates. **The fourth is internationally controversial** - Arab and Gulf nations have officially banned this film primarily because of this specific content.

Previous films have depicted India-Pakistan tensions, Islamic terrorism, intelligence operations. But none triggered bans in places like UAE, where 35-40% of the population is of Indian origin and where Indian cinema is generally celebrated. So what makes this film different? What content crossed the line?

## 26/11 Mumbai Attack: Truth Anchoring + Auditory Conditioning

The film meticulously recreates the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack. We see Kasab and his accomplices arriving by sea from Pakistan, their detailed preparation, weapons procurement, entry into Mumbai - all visually rendered with documentary precision.

Then comes a crucial moment: **the film pauses to play authentic intelligence audio** - the actual voice recordings that intelligence agencies intercepted in real-time. Handlers in Pakistan giving Kasab specific instructions via encrypted satellite phone, identifying targets, coordinating the massacre.

### Truth Anchoring: Weaponizing One Verified Fact

Here's where sophisticated psychological manipulation occurs:

**By inserting one genuine, publicly verifiable piece of evidence**, the filmmakers plant a seed in viewers' minds: "This is documented truth. These are verified facts. This is authentic documentary content."

Then, psychologically primed by this anchor of authenticity, audiences are far more likely to accept the **fictional, speculative, and politically biased scenes** that follow. The critical thinking faculties that might question unverified claims get suspended in the wake of that one moment of verified truth.

In psychological terms, this is **Truth Anchoring and Credibility Transfer:**

- One strong, **verifiable, documented fact** establishes authenticity (real audio recording)
- **Speculative fiction is strategically woven around it** (interpretations, implications, political framing)
- **Credibility automatically transfers** through the halo effect
- Everything else gets perceived as equally authentic and factual  
- Critical thinking capacity becomes temporarily suspended

### Auditory Conditioning: The Sophisticated Manipulation of Background Music

Immediately following this, we see emotionally charged scenes: terrorist handlers in Pakistan watching live TV coverage, celebrating enthusiastically, chanting **"Allah hu Akbar"** loudly, mocking India on the international stage, humiliating the government.

**Here's the most subtle and devastating manipulation: the deliberate psychological weaponization of background music.**

**For scenes depicting 26/11 (during Manmohan Singh government's tenure):**

- **Slow, depressing music conveying defeat and failure**
- **Minor keys evoking hopelessness and despair**
- **Melancholic tones suggesting shame and national embarrassment**
- **Dragging, somber tempo creating a sense of governmental incompetence**
- **Dark, negative emotional undertones throughout**

**For scenes depicting Vajpayee government's actions:**

- **Uplifting, energetic music suggesting victory and decisiveness**
- **Major keys evoking heroism and national pride**
- **Triumphant notes celebrating bravery and glory**
- **Fast-paced, patriotic tempo suggesting effective action**
- **Bright, positive, hopeful emotional undertones**

This is a textbook example of **Auditory Conditioning** and **Musical Framing.** Scientific research consistently demonstrates that background music fundamentally alters **emotional interpretation and cognitive processing.** The exact same visual action can be perceived as heroic courage or villainous cruelty - purely through musical framing.

**Neuroscience research confirms:**
- Music directly activates the amygdala (emotion center)
- It bypasses conscious critical thinking
- It becomes deeply embedded in memory formation
- It shapes long-term perception and recall

### Selective Portrayal: Systematically Framing Government as Weak

Specific dialogue is scripted to drive the point home: **"Look at this government pathetically begging America for help, shameful."** (This explicitly targets Manmohan Singh's Congress government, echoing partisan narratives from WhatsApp forwards and biased TV channels.)

**The systematic negative portrayal suggests:**

- The entire **intelligence apparatus was asleep**, incompetent
- The government **completely failed** on national security
- Officials were **criminally negligent**, irresponsible  
- The government had **no genuine concern** for the country's security

### The Absurd Logic of Gandhi Jayanti

One particularly **illogical and factually baseless dialogue** stands out: **"October 2nd was Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, so critical intelligence information was completely missed because offices were closed."** Ranbir Singh's character delivers this with dramatic anger.

(This is pure **fabricated nonsense** with zero factual basis, unnecessarily targeting Mahatma Gandhi, attempting to blame his legacy for intelligence failures.)

**Consider how absurd this logic is:**

- Between October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti) and November 26 (the attack) there are **55 calendar days**
- Are we seriously expected to believe government offices and intelligence agencies remained closed for **55 consecutive days**?
- Within those 55 days would be numerous working days for processing intelligence
- **This is deliberate creative dishonesty** designed to malign Gandhi's legacy

In this documentary-style segment, the film's pacing slows dramatically, the cinematography shifts, as if we're watching serious investigative journalism. By strategically inserting fictional, politically motivated dialogue alongside historically verifiable incidents, the filmmakers engage in **systematic and deliberate creative dishonesty.**

## Kandahar Hijack 1999: Hiding Failure Behind Patriotism + Selective Amnesia

Now let's examine the film's opening. We're introduced to our **"Desi James Bond"** (R Madhavan).

**The Kandahar Hijack (December 1999):** IC-814 was hijacked and taken to Amritsar, then Lahore, then Dubai, finally landing in Kandahar, Afghanistan - then under **Taliban rule**.

(The same Taliban that returned to power in 2021, whom the current government has welcomed with open arms - ministers embracing them, shaking hands, providing substantial gifts and financial aid. **But the film conveniently omits this context.**)

This incident was no triumph. Yet the film wraps it in patriotic fervor. The Desi James Bond boards the hijacked plane and shouts "Bharat Mata Ki Jai" three times with theatrical enthusiasm. **Legitimate questions get drowned in manufactured patriotic emotion.**

The then Foreign Minister, accompanied by our hero, personally **handed over 3 dangerous terrorists to the Taliban**. This scene of capitulation is scored with **heroic background music**. (Once again, auditory conditioning transforms defeat into victory.)

### The Inconvenient Truth: Maulana Masood Azhar

Under Taliban pressure, the Vajpayee government released **3 dangerous terrorists.** The most notorious: **Maulana Masood Azhar (founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed)**, whose shadow still haunts India:

- **December 2001** - Parliament attack
- **January 2016** - Pathankot airbase attack  
- **September 2016** - Uri attack, 19 soldiers martyred
- **February 2019** - Pulwama attack, 40 soldiers martyred
- **April 2025** - Pahalgam attack, 26 tourists killed
- **November 2025** - Delhi Red Fort area, 15 killed, 20 disabled

**The film doesn't mention any of this.** Because acknowledging these consequences would implicate the 1999 Vajpayee government. So we get selective amnesia disguised as patriotism.

## Parliament Attack 2001: Selective Questioning

**December 2001** - The Parliament attack. Our hero arrives on scene. The atmosphere becomes intensely emotional. We see a female police officer, also a mother (we hear **her child crying in the background**). She's shot in the neck. The imagery is graphic and devastating.

**Once again, legitimate questions dissolve in manufactured emotion.**

**Compare the treatment of these incidents:**

**Manmohan Singh's government** - Relentlessly questioned, saddled with fictional dialogue, even Mahatma Gandhi dragged into criticism.

**Vajpayee's government** - These questions mysteriously disappear:
- How did 5 terrorists enter the nation's capital?
- How did they breach Parliament security?
- Where did the VIP passes come from?
- Where did the red beacon Ambassador car come from?
- Where was intelligence?
- Was there any intelligence input at all?
- What was intelligence doing after releasing 3 terrorists in Kandahar?
- What counter-terrorism measures did the government implement after this attack?

The writer simply "forgot" to ask these questions. The pattern of selective accountability couldn't be clearer.

## Forgetting 26/11's Real Heroes: Selective Amnesia

The film recreates 26/11 in documentary style, but conspicuously omits **18 people who died showing extraordinary bravery.**

At minimum, **Assistant Sub-Inspector Tukaram Omble** deserved recognition - the unarmed officer who grabbed Ajmal Kasab's AK-47 by the barrel. Despite taking over 40 bullets at point-blank range, he held on, ensuring Kasab was captured alive - the only terrorist taken prisoner, providing crucial intelligence.

Apparently, the writer didn't consider this worth depicting. Perhaps because Omble's heroism occurred under the "wrong" government. His sacrifice doesn't fit the narrative, so it gets erased from history.

## Most Controversial Claim: Currency Plates + Character Copying

Finally, we arrive at the claim you probably haven't seen on WhatsApp.

Our Desi James Bond discovers that counterfeit currency is flooding India. From secret intelligence sources, he learns that the currency plates needed for printing were provided by a minister's son, who met a Pakistani hawala broker in Dubai and handed them over.

The time period shown: 2007. The then Finance Minister and his son are **only hinted at** (never named directly in the film).

### Character Copying: Plausible Deniability Through Visual Mimicry

**Here's the most subtle psychological manipulation - never shown explicitly, but given enough hints to eliminate doubt:**

**Makeup and Physical Appearance:**
- Face structure meticulously matched
- Skin tone replicated
- Facial features approximated with prosthetics
- Eye expressions carefully studied and copied

**Dress and Styling:**
- Identical formal suit styling
- Matching tie patterns
- Hair styling precisely replicated
- Same eyeglass frame style

**Movement and Body Language:**
- Walking gait deliberately mimicked
- Hand gestures copied
- Standing posture matched
- Sitting mannerisms replicated

**Speech Patterns and Mannerisms:**
- Speaking rhythm identical
- Word emphasis patterns matched
- Accent and tone replicated
- Pause and hesitation patterns copied
- Head movements duplicated
- Facial expression patterns mimicked
- Specific habits deliberately incorporated

**Everything meticulously crafted so audiences understand "who this represents" - while legally maintaining deniability by never showing a direct face match or stating a name.**

### Manufactured Consent: The Currency Plates Conspiracy

According to the film:

- The minister and his son travel to take delivery of currency plates
- They fabricate an excuse about plane malfunction in London to divert to Dubai
- They meet the Pakistani hawala broker and hand over the plates
- Dubai officials are complicit in the conspiracy

The writer apparently lacks basic understanding of currency and finance protocols. These operations involve **extraordinarily strict procedures** - not just one, but **dozens of security protocols and constant surveillance**.

The film also suggests the company provides technology to Pakistan. What it "forgets" to mention: this is a **212-year-old global company serving 140 countries**. It's not some shady operation - it's a massive multinational with transparent operations worldwide.

**Now, crucial questions the film doesn't address:**

- Counterfeit currency existed before 2004 - which minister provided plates then?
- After Notebandi (2016), fake notes resumed circulation. Who provided those plates?
- New currency series were introduced with different security features - **who provided plates for these?**

Enlighten us, James Bond sahib. Or do these inconvenient facts not fit your narrative?

## Film's Characters: Fake Names, Real Faces - Selective Authenticity

One fascinating pattern: Every character's face, hair, dress deliberately resembles real individuals. For Indian figures, names are slightly changed (often similar-sounding). For Pakistani figures, **actual real names and faces are used**.

What kind of double standard is this? Show everything authentically for Pakistan, but use plausible deniability for India? This itself is a form of creative dishonesty.

## Desi James Bond's Prophecy and Convenient Timing

Our hero knew all of this, delivering dialogue: "All these officials are in league with terrorists. One day a government will come that truly thinks of the country."

Then in 2014, the "true patriot's government" was formed.

And our Desi James Bond, who retired in 2005, was recalled by the new government and placed in the highest position of authority.

But they conveniently forgot to cancel the contract with the very company they accused of complicity. **For over one and a half years, that same company continued operations.**

James Bond has occupied that chair ever since. During his illustrious tenure:

- Pathankot attack
- Uri attack  
- Pulwama attack
- Pahalgam attack
- Red Fort attack
- Manipur burning for two and a half years
- Delicate situation in Ladakh
- Over 1000 riots, including small incidents
- Communal violence becoming routine during Durga Puja and Ram Navami

But apparently, all of this doesn't warrant the same scrutiny. Selective accountability at its finest.

## Arvind Mayaram's Case: Weaponized Selective Memory

One amusing detail: Our hero also "forgot" about Arvind Mayaram for years. They only suddenly remembered him when he joined the Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2023. **Immediately afterwards,** they recalled that he had supposedly helped terrorists many years earlier.

The CBI and entire system are now pressuring him to name "that minister" and implicate him - then they'll let him go.

I'm concerned that if Arvind Mayaram or that minister's son join the "patriotic party" (like 80% of alleged "traitors" from the old party who magically had their sins washed away upon switching sides), whom will they target next? The pattern is transparent.

## IIT-IIM Lectures and Peak Irony

James Bond visits IIT and IIM campuses, delivering inspiring speeches: "Why do you leave the country for money? Stay here. Earn less, but serve the nation. You become CEOs abroad - great achievement - but come back home and contribute."

**Salute to James Bond's moral authority** - his own son is not an Indian citizen, operates as a major businessman abroad. And in 2017, it was revealed he's partnered with a **Pakistani business associate**.

**This is irony at its absolute pinnacle.**

## Censor Board's Transparent Double Standards

The current government ensured this film sailed through the censor board rapidly. Despite being extraordinarily controversial, **not a single cut was mandated.**

Contrast this with:

- Films nearly banned because a heroine's orange bikini was mistaken for saffron
- Films stopped for dialogue like "Man ki baat mat kar, kaam ki baat kar"
- Hundreds of cases where films were delayed or censored for minor infractions

Yet this film, with its inflammatory content and politically motivated allegations, received immediate clearance. The double standard couldn't be more obvious.

## Film's Dangerous Message: Cinema as Political Weapon

What makes this film particularly dangerous is its deliberate blurring of truth and fiction. The writer has cherry-picked real incidents and interwoven them with political malice, fabricated scenes, and speculative conspiracy theories.

Showing India's Finance Minister allegedly providing currency plates to Pakistani hawala brokers, with Dubai officials complicit - this isn't creative freedom. This is internationally damaging propaganda.

Previous films have depicted corrupt leaders, politicians colluding with terrorists - but they kept everything entirely fictional: names, faces, parties, years, incidents. They didn't anchor fiction to specific real events to manufacture credibility.

This film systematically mixes verifiable truth with politically motivated imagination. **This doesn't just damage domestic political discourse - it humiliates India on the international stage.**

India's diplomatic standing has been built over decades - not from 2014, but from independence onwards. For those who believe India only gained "real independence" in 2014, I can only offer ironic congratulations. Meanwhile, check international sentiment analysis: hatred and mistrust toward India have demonstrably increased globally in recent years.

## Conclusion: Not Cinema, But Campaign

And salute to the "brave patriots" who made this film - profiting handsomely in the name of martyred soldiers while enjoying government patronage and benefits. Keep vilifying Gandhi and Nehru, keep branding them traitors through cinema.

**This is not a film. This is a political campaign masquerading as cinema.**

**When art becomes propaganda, when entertainment becomes indoctrination, when cinema becomes psychological warfare - we must name it for what it is.**
