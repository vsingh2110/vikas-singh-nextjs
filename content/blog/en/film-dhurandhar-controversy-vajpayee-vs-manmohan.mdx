# Film 'Dhurandhar' Controversy | Vajpayee Government vs Manmohan Singh Government

The film 'Dhurandhar' has been embroiled in controversies from the start. First Delhi High Court, then when film critics and reviewers published their articles and statements, they were targeted in highly offensive ways.

## Attack on Film Critics: When Questioning Becomes Treason

The biggest case was that **Anupama Chopra**, who has been a film critic for decades and a senior journalist, received extremely vulgar abuses and **threats of gang rape and death threats for her entire family**. Almost every journalist and critic faced filthy comments and abuses.

Everyone was being labeled "Pakistani" and "terrorist supporter". The TV news debates currently ongoing are not discussing the actual issues but circling around terrorism, Pakistan, Muslims - whereas the critics had raised criticism about something entirely different.

**The psychological tactic is simple** - link dissent with treason, so people think a hundred times before questioning. This is **discourse policing** - creating an environment where questioning itself seems criminal.

## First Betrayal with a Martyred Soldier

I don't know about lies and propaganda in the film, but **creative dishonesty has definitely been committed under the name of creative freedom**. One party was heavily targeted, another was shown in great light. Critics were saying the same thing, so the entire troll system was unleashed on them.

**The first betrayal** was with the film's hero character - the martyred soldier himself. Major Mohit Sharma's parents went to Delhi High Court. They said "The hero's character in the trailer is exactly like our son. When Major went on an undercover mission as a Kashmiri Muslim to infiltrate terrorist groups, he had grown his hair and beard exactly like this."

His brother told Hindustan Times - "We don't want even one rupee from the film's profits, but if they're creating something inspired by my brother, at least write his name somewhere in the film."

The news was everywhere on social media. Instagram influencers and YouTubers made tons of videos. **Not one person from the entire film team said anything and they were promoting heavily.** Possibly this entire game was orchestrated by an advertising agency for money - exactly like a targeted campaign.

But when the matter reached court, director **Aditya Dhar** (who is also the writer and producer) immediately issued an official statement on Twitter/X - "This is not based on Major Mohit Sharma's life."

**In one stroke, all responsibility was wiped off.** This is a perfect example of **cognitive dissonance marketing**.

## Film's Dual Identity: Fiction or Documentary?

The film clearly states at the beginning: **"This film is based on fictional events. It has no connection with any person, object, event, or group."**

But when we watch the film, in many places it looks like a documentary. **This narrative ambiguity is deliberately created** - to make the audience believe they're watching "true events," while maintaining the "fiction" label for legal protection.

There are only four incidents in the film where objections have been raised. Three are known to everyone - debated thousands of times on WhatsApp and TV news. **The fourth incident is highly objectionable**, and this is why Arab and Gulf countries have banned this film.

## 26/11 Mumbai Attack: Truth Anchoring Game

The film shows the 26/11 Mumbai attack. How Kasab and his companions came from Pakistan, all shown. Then **the film is paused to play a real voice recording** that intelligence agencies had traced and recorded at that time.

**Here's a very clever psychological technique** - by inserting real recording, plant in the viewer's mind that "all this is true." Then whatever fictional scenes follow, viewers will also consider them true. This is called **truth anchoring**.

After this, it's shown that terrorists sitting in Pakistan are watching this on TV, **shouting "Allah hu Akbar"** slogans. There's even a dialogue - "Look how this government is begging for help from America." (Clear indication towards Manmohan Singh's government.)

It's being shown that entire intelligence was sleeping, government had no concern for the country.

And a **ridiculous dialogue** - **"October 2nd was a holiday, so intelligence information was missed."** (Mahatma Gandhi unnecessarily targeted.)

**Aditya Dhar's logic is strange** - between October 2nd and November 26th there were **55 days**. So were government offices closed for 55 days? **This is creative dishonesty done under the name of creative freedom.**

## Kandahar Hijack 1999: Hiding Failure with Patriotism

At the film's beginning, our **Desi James Bond** (R Madhavan) is shown.

**Kandahar Hijack (December 1999):** IC-814 was hijacked. The plane was taken to Amritsar, Lahore, Dubai and finally landed in Afghanistan's Kandahar where **Taliban ruled** at that time.

(The same Taliban that came back to power in 2021, **which the current government welcomes with red carpet**. Ministers with laser-shooting eyes are hugging them, shaking hands, giving plenty of gifts and financial aid. **But the film forgot to show this.**)

This incident was shameful. But here a **patriotic scene was added** to wrap up the matter. Desi James Bond goes into the flight and shouts "Bharat Mata Ki Jai" three times. **Questions arising in minds were buried in patriotic emotions.**

The then Foreign Minister and James Bond personally **handed over 3 terrorists to Taliban**. In this scene, instead of failure, it's shown with **heroic background sound**. (Background music changes the entire meaning of a scene - **auditory conditioning**.)

### Truth: Maulana Masood Azhar

Taliban pressured Vajpayee government to release **3 dangerous terrorists**. The most dangerous was **Maulana Masood Azhar (Jaish-e-Mohammed)** whom we're suffering till today:

- **December 2001** - Parliament attack
- **January 2016** - Pathankot airbase attack
- **September 2016** - Uri, 19 soldiers martyred
- **February 2019** - Pulwama, 40 soldiers martyred
- **April 2025** - Pahalgam, 26 tourists killed
- **November 2025** - Delhi Red Fort area, 15 killed, 20 disabled

**But the film doesn't have a single word about all this.** Because all this becomes the responsibility of 1999 Vajpayee government.

## Parliament Attack 2001: Selective Questioning

**December 2001** - Parliament attack. James Bond reaches here too, entire atmosphere becomes emotional. A female police officer who is also a mother is shown (**her child's crying voice is heard in background**). She's shot in the neck, face looks gruesome.

**Here too, questions arising in minds were erased in emotions.**

**So analyzing three scenes:**

**From Manmohan Singh's government** - asked all questions in the world, wrote fictional dialogues, dragged Mahatma Gandhi too.

**In Vajpayee's government** - forgot to ask all those questions:
- How did 5 terrorists enter the nation's capital?
- How did they reach inside Parliament?
- Where did VIP pass come from?
- Where did the red beacon Ambassador car come from?
- After releasing 3 terrorists, what was intelligence doing?
- What retaliatory action was taken after this attack?

**The writer forgot all this.**

## Forgetting 26/11 Heroes

Writer showed 26/11 documentary but forgot **18 martyred security personnel**.

**Tukaram Omble** - who was unarmed, grabbed Kasab's AK-47 barrel. **Even after taking 40 bullets at point-blank range**, held Kasab. The only terrorist captured alive.

**Writer didn't consider this necessary either** because the film had to show **Rahman Dakait's (Akshay Khanna's brilliant performance)** swagger, who was shouting "Allah hu Akbar" watching TV news. **Akshay Khanna performed Rahman Dakait's character so explosively that the entire internet was filled with his praise - he got the most appreciation in the film.**

Maybe the writer considered Omble as Congress's soldier, not India's. Anyway, writer's wish. He's a patriot and favorite of those in power.

**Don't ever question this**, otherwise martyred soldiers will be insulted and you'll be called anti-national. Yes, but **you can question everything about Manmohan Singh** - no one's insult will be counted.

## Most Controversial: Currency Plates

And finally that thing you probably haven't read even on WhatsApp.

James Bond states that fake currency notes are flooding in. Pakistan's ISI is printing them. And **currency plates were given by our minister's son to a Pakistani hawala dealer in Dubai.**

2007 timing shown. Here **only hints are given about that time's Finance Minister and his son - by stating name and timing**. Face not directly shown, **but everyone has understood.**

**Film shows:**
- Minister and son go from London to Dubai on private jet
- Give currency plates to Pakistani hawala dealer
- Dubai officials also involved (that's why Dubai banned it)

**Currency and finance have very strict protocols.** Delivery doesn't happen like this. From that country to ours, there are **over 50 protocols**.

Film says the same company gave technology to Pakistan too. But this is a **212-year-old company serving 140 countries**. Anyway, creative freedom.

**My one question** - even before 2004, fake notes problem existed, which minister was giving plates then? And **after demonetization (2016), everything ended for a year, then fake notes started again. They still come.** Pakistan is still printing. Now there are new notes, **who gave these plates?** Tell this too.

Everyone on Instagram and YouTube has become enlightened. All RAW, IB secrets known, and 2007's Finance Minister was running Al-Qaeda and ISI.

## Film Characters: Fake Names, But Clear Hints

**One interesting thing** - In India, characters' names changed (and similar), but from timing and context everyone understands. **In Pakistan, all real names** - Bhutto, Zardari, Rahman, SP Chaudhary, party names, elections, everything.

Show everything true for Pakistan, twist a bit for India? **This is also dishonesty.**

## Selective Enforcement: Arvind Mayaram's Case

James Bond knew everything, and in 2007 there's a dialogue - "All officials are with terrorists, and **one day such a government will come that will think about the country**."

Then in 2014, **government of true patriots** formed. After 1192, after 800 years, a real Hindu sat on Delhi's chair. (Who was Vajpayee then? Anyway, who's real Hindu who's fake, they decide all that.)

**James Bond (retired in 2005)** was called back, **given the biggest chair.** (Film shows him most important - entire story revolves around him.)

**But they forgot** - the company accused of currency plates, **its contract wasn't canceled.** **For over 1.5 years** the same company kept working. Anyway, memory sometimes weakens.

Then James Bond **sits on that chair till today.** During his tenure:
- Pathankot, Uri, Pulwama, Pahalgam, Red Fort attacks
- **Manipur burned for two and half years**
- Ladakh situation precarious
- **Over 1000 riots** (never seen so many riots)
- Riot on every festival became routine

### Forgot to Catch Arvind Mayaram

**James Bond forgot to get Arvind Mayaram caught.** They remembered years later - **when Mayaram joined Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2023.** Immediately remembered that he helped terrorists many years ago.

Mayaram was in Finance Ministry. Then CBI pressured - **name that minister, we'll release you.**

**I'm afraid** that Mayaram and minister's son might **join the "patriot party"** (like 80% traitors from old party became pure after joining), then **whom will James Bond catch?**

## IIT-IIM Lectures and Irony

James Bond goes to IIT, IIM to give patriotic lectures. Tells students - "Don't leave the country for money. Stay here, serve the nation."

**Salute to James Bond** - **his son is not an Indian citizen**, is a businessman abroad. In 2017 it was revealed - **working with Pakistani business partner.**

**This is the height of irony.**

## Censor Board's Double Standards

**Current government deliberately** got it passed from censor board in a hurry. Despite being so controversial, **not one cut**, completely passed.

Otherwise:
- Heroine's orange bikini stopped the film (couldn't understand difference between orange and saffron)
- **"Don't do man ki baat, do kaam ki baat"** dialogue stopped the film
- Small mistakes lead to cut demands

**This film got green signal.**

## Conclusion: Cinema or Campaign?

Film shows **neither complete truth nor complete fiction**. Writer wrote scenes with political vendetta mixing imagination with true events.

Showing India's Finance Minister meeting Pakistani hawala dealer in Dubai - **is nation's insult.**

Earlier too, corrupt leaders were shown, **but names, faces, party, year - all kept fictional.** Here, mixed truth with imagination - **directly political.**

India's respect in world **has been since beginning, not since 2014**. Those who think real independence came after 2014, salute to them. **Check internet - how much hatred against India increased in last 5-6 years.**

**Salute to filmmakers** - earn tons of money on martyred soldiers' names, get full benefit from government. Keep abusing Gandhi, Nehru, keep proving them traitors.

**This is not a film, it's a political campaign** being run through cinema.

**Most dangerous** - **if you don't watch this film, you're a "traitor".** This is the murder of discourse. Attempt to turn dissent into treason.

**Jai Hind.**
