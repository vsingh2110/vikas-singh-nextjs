# Film Dhurandhar Controversy | Vajpayee Government vs Manmohan Singh Government | Psychological Warfare

## Opening Note: Akshay Khanna's Timeless Performance

**After watching this film, I found the action sequences enjoyable**, beautiful characters and good shooting, excellent cinematography. **But what created a storm - Akshay Khanna's portrayal of Rahman Dakait created a whirlwind across the internet.** Despite a 26-year acting career, the incredibly intense **timeless** deep role he delivered made even established superstars pale in comparison.

**Rahman Dakait's character is extremely powerful** and only Akshay Khanna could pull this off - social media trending, critics' reviews with glowing mentions, audiences' reactions with overwhelming response - everyone acknowledged this is his career's best performance. Such intensity, such conviction, such menace and terror in this role, it's unforgettable.

**I initially started watching the film just to see this brilliant actor.** Whatever the film's message, whatever the action sequences' entertainment, whatever the technical brilliance. But here **this is full of psychological manipulation**, such subtle psychological techniques have been systematically used, which people don't understand and keep falling into the trap.

**As a Social Psychologist, I say**, I will now analyze the film - from a **comprehensive propaganda analysis** perspective, systematically explaining how advanced psychological techniques like **Cognitive Dissonance Marketing, Truth Anchoring, Discourse Policing, Auditory Conditioning, Narrative Ambiguity, Selective Amnesia, Emotional Manipulation, and Manufactured Consent** have been deliberately and systematically deployed.

## Attack on Film Critics: Discourse Policing and Social Psychology

The film Dhurandhar has been embroiled in controversies from the start. First Delhi High Court, then when film critics and reviewers published their articles and statements, they were targeted in highly offensive ways, professional criticism became difficult, and there was an attempt to create an organized and systematic culture of silence in society.

### Organized Trolling: Systematic Silencing Campaign Architecture

The biggest case was that **Anupama Chopra**, who has been an established film critic for decades, a senior journalist, founder of Film Companion, highly respected woman in the literary and film world, **was targeted in extremely disgusting ways** - critics like Raja Sen, Anupama Chopra, and other independent critics - all faced filthy mother-sister abuses, heavy sexual insults and violent threats pouring down.

**This is a perfect example of Coordinated Digital Attack Pattern:**

- **Mass Mobilization** - Thousands of fake and real accounts simultaneously active, coordinated timing
- **Threat Escalation Ladder** - First mild criticism, then personal attacks, then family threats, then death/rape threats - systematic progression
- **Family Targeting Strategy** - Critics' families exposed, children's photos shared (classic tactic of psychological warfare)
- **Platform Flooding** - Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube - simultaneous coordinated attack on all platforms
- **Hashtag Hijacking** - Organized brigading on every critic's post
- **Doxxing Attempts** - Attempts to leak personal information

Everyone was being labeled "Pakistani" and "terrorist supporter." They were all talking about their concerns, but those were not addressed at all - film's actual problems, creative liberties, factual inaccuracies - were not answered. Just raised loud slogans of **treason, terrorism, patriotism, national security**, whereas what criticism had the critics raised about what issues - historical distortion, political bias, selective narrative - and to whom?

### Discourse Policing: Psychology of Linking Dissent with Treason

**The psychological tactic is simple and extremely effective:**

Link dissent with treason, call criticism anti-national, label questioning as betrayal - this makes people think a hundred times before questioning, they fear. This is **Discourse Policing** - and creating such a threatening environment systematically:

**Psychological Effects:**

- **Self-Censorship emerges** - People start mentally filtering what to say
- **Fear of Social Backlash** - Constant fear of being professionally and socially targeted
- **Anticipatory Obedience** - Comply in advance today, then no problem will arise
- **Fear of Social Ostracism** - Fear of being separated from family, community, professional circle
- **Chilling Effect on Free Speech** - Freedom of expression gradually diminishes, no space for debate
- **Normalization of Aggression** - Gradually such threats start seeming normal

This is a classic and well-documented move from the **Authoritarian Playbook**. History shows that authoritarian regimes always do this - call dissent treason, call criticism conspiracy, declare questioners enemy of the state.

## Major Mohit Sharma Case Controversy: Cognitive Dissonance Marketing

I don't know about lies and propaganda in the film, there are many factual inaccuracies that should be debated, but I can confirm that **systematic creative dishonesty under the name of creative freedom** has definitely been done. One party was heavily targeted methodically, another party was deliberately shown as ideal, selective questioning saved them by sidelining them to raise points, and **their organized troll system** - which is clearly coordinated too - was unleashed on them.

### Major Mohit Sharma Case: Masterclass in Viral Marketing

Before talking about the film in detail, it's important to discuss the **pre-release controversy before the film officially released**, which is actually something worth researching in marketing psychology.

**The first betrayal** - which is very calculated - was done to the main hero's character itself, the martyred soldier. **Major Mohit Sharma's parents** went to Delhi High Court. While filing the petition, they said with specific details:

> "The hero's character in the film trailer, his appearance, his look is exactly like their son. When Major went on an undercover mission as a Kashmiri Muslim to infiltrate terrorist groups, which was a highly dangerous mission, he had grown his hair and beard exactly like this, adopted this specific look. Many detail-to-detail things seem to have been copied by the filmmakers. We're not asking for much, we're asking a simple question that why was permission not sought from us, did anyone come to ask for permission?"

His brother gave a very emotional yet dignified statement in an interview with Hindustan Times - **"We don't want even one rupee from the film's commercial profits, we don't want monetary compensation, we just want to know that if they were inspired by our brother, if they got something from his life story, at least they should have contacted us once, our brother's, our simple acknowledgment was needed?"

### Viral Marketing Strategy's Psychological Analysis

Then everywhere - mainstream news channels, digital news platforms, social media everywhere it went viral. Instagram influencers made emotional videos, YouTubers released detailed analysis videos, Twitter trending. **But the most interesting thing was that no one from the film team said anything publicly**, no clarification issued, no response given, but kept aggressively promoting the film behind the controversy.

**This showed classical characteristics of an Orchestrated Marketing Campaign:**

- **Controversy = Publicity Formula** - negative news is also publicity
- Origin of news from where, no one knows, mysterious leak happened - mysterious
- Possibly **strategically paid promotion** type orchestrated was this entire thing
- This heavy **targeted viral campaign**'s all characteristics - timing, platforms, messaging
- **Emotional Connect Building** - gaining sympathy from audience
- **Free Organic Publicity** - crores worth of free media coverage
- **Curiosity Creation** - rapidly increasing curiosity among people about the film

### 180-Degree Turn at Court: Exploitation of Cognitive Dissonance

But the interesting twist came when the matter legally reached the high court, formal legal notice came, then director **Aditya Dhar** (who simultaneously is the writer, producer, and director of this film) immediately, right away issued an official public statement on Twitter/X saying - **"This film is absolutely not based on Major Mohit Sharma's real life, it is fictional."**

**In one stroke, legally, all responsibility was washed off.** Escaped from legal liability.

This is an absolute textbook example of **Cognitive Dissonance Marketing**, a masterclass in advertising psychology:

**Dual Messaging Strategy:**

- **Let Public Perception build** - This is a real story, based on true events, authentic (strong emotional connection built with people)
- **Legally never explicitly claimed** - Fiction disclaimer put up, so no one sues (complete protection from lawsuits)
- **Both benefits taken simultaneously** - emotional authenticity connect + legal safety shield
- **Contradictory Signals Deliberately given** - People got confused, but remained interested, remained curious

**Audience Psychology:**
- People kept believing what they thought - "real story hai"
- But legally film makers remained protected - "hum ne toh kabhi claim hi nahi kiya"
- This is deliberately creating and exploiting cognitive dissonance.

Their direct interest was also there. Because filmmakers had a **strategic compulsion**, because the content they wanted to show was politically charged content truth be told, controversial claims had to be made, many fictional elements, speculative theories, and politically motivated interpretations also had to be added. If they directly used the real martyr's official name, then many legal defamation suits would come, the family would have a very strong legal case.

## Film's Dual Identity: Psychology of Narrative Ambiguity

The film shows a clear, prominently displayed disclaimer at the beginning (which is in almost every film as standard legal protection):

> **"This film is based on fictional events. It has no connection with any real person, object, place, group, incident. If it seems so, it is purely coincidental."**

But when we watch the film attentively, analyze it, then in many places this is **stylistically shot and presented like a serious documentary or detailed news presentation**. Most of the part looks like a typical Bollywood style heavy masala action film, with dramatic music, but some specific segments completely change to Discovery Channel documentary style - slow pacing, serious tone, archival footage feel?

### Psychological Technique: Deliberate Strategic Ambiguity

This **narrative ambiguity is deliberately, strategically created**:

**Strategic Benefits:**

- **Legal Deniability remains intact** - In court can say "Fiction disclaimer was clearly written"
- **Emotional Believability maximize** - Audience feels genuine "This is all true, real events"
- **Legal Protection Shield** - Defamation suits won't even come, technically correct
- **Psychological Manipulation** - Viewer's critical thinking gets suspended, believe what's shown
- **Best of Both Worlds** - fiction's freedom + non-fiction's credibility

**Only four major incidents are critical in the film** on which serious objections were raised. Three are already well-known to everyone - discussed before on WhatsApp forwards, TV news debates. **The fourth incident is considered internationally highly objectionable**, because of exactly this specific content the governments of Arab and Gulf countries have imposed an official ban on this film.

## 26/11 Mumbai Attack: Truth Anchoring + Auditory Conditioning

The film recreated the detailed scene of the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack. How Kasab and his companion terrorists specifically came from Pakistan via sea to Mumbai, heap-heap detailed preparation, from where weapons came, how they entered Mumbai - all this is shown visually in detail. Then comes the dramatic moment **the film is paused in between to play an authentic voice recording** in audio which in reality actual intelligence agencies had technically traced and recorded in real-time. Handlers from Pakistan were giving specific instructions to Kasab via encrypted satellite phone, telling what targets would be.

### Truth Anchoring: Making Everything Credible with One Verifiable Fact

Here a very sophisticated and calculated **psychological manipulation technique** was used:

**By inserting a real publicly available voice recording, this thing was planted deeply in the audience's mind** that "this is all documented truth, verified facts, authentic documentary content." Then psychologically after this when fictional, speculative, and politically biased scenes come one after another, subconsciously viewers will consider them equally truthful and factual too, will forget to critically analyze.

**If we understand this in psychological terminology, then Truth Anchoring and Credibility Transfer:**

- One strong **verifiable documented fact** authentically present (real audio recording)
- Around that strategically **speculative fiction carefully weave** (interpretations, implications)
- Psychological **Credibility automatically Transfer** happens then - halo effect
- Rest all the viewer considers equally authentic and factual
- Critical thinking capacity temporarily suspended

### Auditory Conditioning: Sophisticated Manipulation of Background Music

Immediately after that emotionally charged scenes are shown that terrorist handlers sitting in Pakistan and their supporters are watching this on TV live coverage in real-time, celebrating happily, **loudly enthusiastically shouting "Allah hu Akbar"** slogans, mocking India heavily internationally, humiliating our government.

**Here the most important subtle - Deliberate Psychological Manipulation of Background Music:**

**For scenes of 26/11 specifically (during Manmohan Singh government's tenure):**

- **Slow, depressing music of Defeat and Failure** - Plays feeling of defeat
- **Minor key of Hopelessness and Despair** - No hope at all feel
- **Melancholic notes of Shame and Embarrassment** - Deep sense of national humiliation
- **Slow, dragging, depressing tempo** - Feels like everything ended, government failed feel
- **Somber, dark, negative emotional undertones** - complete negativity

**For scenes specifically of Vajpayee government's tenure:**

- **Uplifting, energetic music of Victory and Success** - Victorious patriotic feeling
- **Major key of Heroism and Bravery** - Valor openly heard feel
- **Triumphant notes of Pride and National Glory** - Pride naturally felt
- **Uplifting, fast-paced, patriotic tempo** - Feels like something decisively happened feel
- **Bright, positive, hopeful emotional undertones** - complete positivity

This is an absolutely classic and well-researched example of **Auditory Conditioning** and **Musical Framing**. Scientific studies prove that background music in any scene fundamentally changes **emotional interpretation and cognitive processing**. The exact same visual action can be perceived as hero's bravery or villain's cruelty - just by changing music.

**Neuroscience Research:**
- Music directly activates amygdala (emotion center)
- Bypasses conscious critical thinking
- Deeply embeds in memory formation
- Shapes long-term perception

### Selective Portrayal: Systematically Showing Government as Weak

Here several specific dialogues are explicitly scripted - **"Look at this government, how pathetically it's begging desperately from America for help, begging for assistance, shameful"** (This is clearly targeting Manmohan Singh's Congress government. Exactly the same biased framing shown systematically on WhatsApp forwards and partisan TV channels)

**Systematic Negative Portrayal:**

Here deliberately this impression is created that:
- Entire **intelligence apparatus was completely sleeping**, incompetent
- Government towards national security **totally failed**, useless
- All officials were **criminally negligent**, irresponsible
- Government had **no concern for country's security** at all

### Absurd Logic of 2 October: Illogical Scapegoating

And one completely **absurd, illogical, and factually baseless dialogue** shown with no rational logic - **"October 2nd was a holiday for Gandhi Jayanti being a national holiday, so critical intelligence information was completely missed because of the holiday, processing didn't happen."** Ranbir Singh's character says dramatically, showing emotional anger.

(This is purely **fabricated nonsense** with no factual basis at all, deliberately targeted Mahatma Gandhi unnecessarily, unfairly blamed his legacy, attempted to indirectly blame his legacy)

**But think how ridiculously Flawed this Logic is - just check basic timeline:**

- Between 2 October (Gandhi Jayanti) and actual attack day 26 November there are full **55 calendar days**
- How is it realistically **possible for 55 days** government offices, intelligence agencies everything remained closed?
- In those 55 days there would be many working days for processing
- **This is deliberate fictional creative dishonesty** to conveniently comfortably target Mahatma Gandhi to justify against him

In the film specifically in this documentary-style segment consciously the film's pacing was dramatically slowed down, cinematography changed, as if we're watching a serious investigative documentary on Discovery Channel. Deliberately adding fictional politically motivated dialogue and speculative reconstructed scenes strategically with this historically verifiable true incident, the filmmaker has done **systematic deliberate fictional creative dishonesty** methodically.

## Kandahar Hijack 1999: Hiding Failure with Patriotism + Selective Amnesia

Well, now let's talk about the beginning portions of the film. At the beginning our **Desi James Bond** (R Madhavan) is shown.

**Kandahar Hijack (December 1999):** IC-814 was hijacked. The plane was taken to Amritsar, Lahore, Dubai and landed in Afghanistan's Kandahar where at that time **Taliban ruled**.

(The same Taliban that came back to power after 20 years in 2021, **which the current government welcomes with red carpet**. Ministers with laser-shooting eyes are hugging, shaking hands, giving plenty of gifts and financial aid. **But the film forgot to show this.**)

This incident was not a matter of great pride. But here a **patriotic scene was added** to wrap up the matter. Desi James Bond goes into the flight and shouts "Bharat Mata Ki Jai" three times with full enthusiasm. **Questions arising in minds were buried in patriotic emotions.**

The then Foreign Minister and James Bond personally **handed over 3 terrorists to Taliban**. In this scene, instead of failure, shown with **heroic background sound**. (Background music changes the entire meaning of a scene - **auditory conditioning**.)

### Truth: Maulana Masood Azhar

Taliban pressured Vajpayee government to release **3 dangerous terrorists**. The most dangerous **Maulana Masood Azhar (Jaish-e-Mohammed)** whom we're suffering till today:

- **December 2001** - Parliament attack
- **January 2016** - Pathankot airbase attack
- **September 2016** - Uri, 19 soldiers martyred
- **February 2019** - Pulwama, 40 soldiers martyred
- **April 2025** - Pahalgam, 26 tourists killed
- **November 2025** - Delhi Red Fort area, 15 killed, 20 disabled

**But the film doesn't have a single word about all this.** Because all this becomes the responsibility of 1999 Vajpayee government.

## Parliament Attack 2001: Selective Questioning

**December 2001** - Parliament attack. Here too James Bond reaches, entire atmosphere becomes emotional. A female police officer who is also a mother is shown (**her child's crying voice is heard in background**). Her neck is shot, face looks gruesome.

**Here too, questions arising in minds were erased in emotions.**

**So analyzing three scenes:**

**From Manmohan Singh's government** - asked all the questions in the world, wrote fictional dialogues, dragged Mahatma Gandhi too.

**In Vajpayee's government** - forgot to ask all those questions:
- How did 5 terrorists enter the nation's capital?
- How did they reach inside Parliament?
- Where did VIP pass come from?
- Where did the red beacon Ambassador car come from?
- Where was intelligence sleeping?
- Was there any intel input or not?
- What was intelligence doing after releasing 3 terrorists?
- What counter-action did the government take after this attack?

All this the writer forgot to write.

## Forgetting 26/11's Real Heroes: Selective Amnesia

The writer showed the 26/11 documentary, but forgot to show that **18 people were martyred showing bravery.**

At least **Tukaram Omble** could have been shown - who was unarmed and caught Ajmal Kasab, grabbing his AK-47's barrel. Even after taking 40 bullets at point-blank range, kept Kasab under control, and the only terrorist was caught alive.

The writer didn't think showing this was necessary either. Perhaps the writer considered him not as India's soldier but as Congress's.

## Most Controversial Claim: Currency Plates + Character Copying Details

And finally that thing which you probably haven't read even on WhatsApp.

Desi James Bond says fake notes are flooding the country. From secret sources it was found that the currency plates needed for them, our country's minister's son himself called a Pakistan hawala broker to Dubai and gave them.

Showing the time of 2007. Here towards the then Finance Minister and his son **only hints were given** (name not mentioned in the film).

### Character Copying: Makeup, Face, Dress, Walking Style, Pronunciation

**Here very subtle psychological manipulation - not shown directly, but gave so many hints that no confusion remains:**

**Makeup and Face:**
- Face structure kept exactly similarly huhuhuh similar
- Skin tone matching
- Matched face structure with prosthetics
- Eyes' expression pattern copied

**Dress and Appearance:**
- Same formal suit
- Tie's pattern and style
- Hair styling exactly the same
- Glasses' same frame

**Walking Style and Body Language:**
- Walking manner exactly copied
- Hand waving gesture
- Standing posture
- Sitting manner

**Pronunciation and Speaking Style:**
- Speaking rhythm exactly same
- Emphasis pattern on words
- Accent and tone matching
- Pause and hesitation patterns copied

**Mannerisms:**
- Hand's specific gestures
- Head movements
- Facial expressions pattern
- Copied specific habits

**All this was done so meticulously that audience understands "whose matter is this" - but legally nowhere shown direct face or name.**

### Manufactured Consent: Currency Plates Controversy

Shown in the film:

- Minister and son go to take delivery of currency plates
- Make excuse of plane malfunction in London to go to Dubai
- Come after giving plates to Pakistan hawala broker
- Dubai officials also in on it with everyone

The writer has no common sense - work related to currency and finance has very strict protocol. Not one, but **more than 50 times protocols and strict surveillance everywhere**.

Also showed that the company gives technology to Pakistan too. But forgot that it's a **212-year-old world company that serves 140 countries**.

**Now one question:**

- Before 2004 also there was fake note problem, then which minister went to give plates?
- After Notebandi (2016) again fake notes started coming. Less or more, Pakistan is still printing them.
- Now there are new notes (new series), **who gave the plates for these?**

Tell this too, James Bond sir.

## Film's Characters: Fake Names, Real Faces - Emotional Manipulation

One interesting thing - every character's face, hair, dress all kept exactly like real people. In India only changed names, that too similar-sounding. But in Pakistan showed everyone's real names-faces.

What kind of thing is this? Show everything real for Pakistan, change name a little for India? This is also a kind of dishonesty.

## Desi James Bond's Prediction and Selective Enforcement

Desi James Bond knew all this, and dialogue written - "All officials are in league with terrorists, and one day such a government will come that will think of the country."

Then in 2014 the true patriot's government was formed.

And Desi James Bond who retired in 2005, the new government called back and put on the biggest chair.

But perhaps they forgot that the company they were accusing, forgot to cancel its contract. **For more than one and a half years the same company kept working.**

Then James Bond has been sitting on the chair from then till today. And during his tenure:

- Pathankot attack
- Uri attack
- Pulwama attack
- Pahalgam attack
- Red Fort attack
- Manipur burned for two and a half years
- Ladakh's condition is delicate
- Including small ones, more than 1000 riots happened
- Riot on every Durga Puja, Ram Navami became routine

## Arvind Mayaram's Case: Selective Memory

And one funny thing - Desi James Bond also forgot to catch Arvind Mayaram. They remembered years later, when Arvind Mayaram joined Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2023. **Immediately after that remembered** that he had helped terrorists many years ago.

CBI and the entire system are pressuring him to name that minister and trap him, then will let you go.

I'm afraid that Arvind Mayaram and that minister's son might join the "patriot party" (like 80% traitor people from old party came and all sins washed), then whom will they catch?

## IIT-IIM Lectures and Irony

James Bond goes to IIT, IIM and says - "Why do you leave the country for money? Stay here, earn less money but serve the country. You become CEO abroad, good thing, but come back."

**Salute to James Bond** - his own son is not a citizen of India, a very big businessman abroad. And in 2017 it was found he's working with a **Pakistani business partner**.

**This is the height of irony.**

## Censor Board's Double Standards

The current government deliberately got it passed from censor board in a hurry. Even after being so controversial, didn't get even one cut done.

Otherwise we've seen:

- Heroine's orange bikini almost got the film banned (Censor board couldn't differentiate between orange and saffron)
- "Man ki baat mat kar, kaam ki baat kar" dialogue got film stopped
- Hundreds of cases where film stopped for small mistake

But this film got green signal.

## Film's Dangerous Message: Manufactured Consent

Showing this is quite dangerous. There's neither complete truth in it, nor completely fictional. The writer from his whim with a real incident wrote scenes in political malice.

Showing India's Finance Minister giving currency plates to a Pakistani hawala broker along with Dubai officials is quite condemnable.

Earlier also films were made, leaders shown corrupt, shown in league with terrorists, but names, faces, party, year - all kept completely fictional. Didn't add any similar incident.

But here throughout the film truth mixed with imagination shown. This will humiliate our country in the world.

India's diplomatic respect in the world has been great - not from 2014, from the beginning itself. Rest who think the country got real independence only after 2014, salute them. And check on internet, how much hatred towards India has increased in the whole world in the last 5-6 years.

## Conclusion: Cinema or Campaign?

And salute to the brave son of Mother India who made the film - earn loads of money in the name of the country's martyred soldiers, and also keep earning benefits from the government. Keep abusing Gandhi, Nehru like this, keep proving them traitors by making films.

**This is not a film, this is a political campaign being run through the medium of cinema.**
